            <div class="sectionParagraph"> I'm a Web Developer based in the Greater Chicago area. Currently I am looking for positions working in the entire stack. I've been coding for
                about a year and am eager to start my career. I work well with others to achieve a common goal. I am great in teams but if needed can work well autonomously too. I have a lot 
                of experience managing multiple projects at once and am very good at time management.  
            </div>
            <div class="sectionParagraph"> I hold a Bachelors of Administration in Information Systems from the University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business. I am pursuing a certificate
                from Northwestern University's Trilogy Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp program. Once the program is finished, I will have knowledge of many languages, frameworks, and database 
                applications. I will be an incredibly versatile jack of all trades and a master of some.
            </div>
            <div class="sectionParagraph"> In my free-time I enjoy playing music on my various instruments including my guitars, drum kit, and other small instruments. I love nothing more than to
                cruise down the Lake Shore Trail on my bike on a cool September afternoon. I enjoy all types of food and am willing to try anything once. I like to travel any chance I get - my most
                 memorable trips include visiting the Bahamas, Jamaica, London, and Colorado Springs. I am a skiier, snowboarder, and skateboarder, and like to play golf and tennis.
