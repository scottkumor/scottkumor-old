          I'm a Web Developer based in the Greater Chicago area. Currently I am
          looking for positions working in the entire stack. I've been coding
          for about a year and am eager to start my career. I work well with
          others to achieve a common goal. I am great in teams but if needed can
          work well autonomously too. I have a lot of experience managing
          multiple projects at once and am very good at time management.

          I hold a Bachelors of Administration in Information Systems from the
          University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business. I am pursuing a
          certificate from Northwestern University's Trilogy Full Stack Web
          Development Boot Camp program. Once the program is finished, I will
          have knowledge of many languages, frameworks, and database
          applications. I will be an incredibly versatile jack of all trades and
          a master of some.

          In my free-time I enjoy playing music on my various instruments
          including my guitars, drum kit, and other small instruments. I love
          nothing more than to cruise down the Lake Shore Trail on my bike on a
          cool September afternoon. I enjoy all types of food and am willing to
          try anything once. I like to travel any chance I get - my most
          memorable trips include visiting the Bahamas, Jamaica, London, and
          Colorado Springs. I am a skiier, snowboarder, and skateboarder, and
          like to play golf and tennis.
